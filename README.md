# SVM-Classification-vs-Regression-SVR-with-scikit-learn
A comprehensive tutorial demonstrating Support Vector Machine (SVM) concepts with separate, minimal code examples using scikit-learn ‚Äî including classification, regression (SVR), hyperplanes, margins, kernels, support vectors, and more.

This repository provides a detailed walkthrough of Support Vector Machines (SVM) using scikit-learn with clean, separate code examples for each core concept. Whether you're a beginner or refreshing your ML knowledge, you'll find code snippets and visualizations that clearly explain:

* What is an SVM?
* Understanding Hyperplanes and Margins
* Visualizing Support Vectors
* Linear vs Non-Linear SVM
* Kernel Functions (Linear, RBF, Polynomial, Sigmoid)
* Effects of C and gamma parameters
* SVM for Classification and Regression (SVR)
* Practical examples on popular datasets like Iris and Diabetes

Each concept is covered in its own standalone Python file or notebook for clarity and easy learning. Ideal for students, ML practitioners, and developers looking to grasp SVM intuitively.

**SVM for Classification:** The model finds the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes with maximum margin.

**SVR (Support Vector Regression):** The model fits a hyperplane that predicts continuous values while allowing for a margin of tolerance (Œµ-insensitive zone).

### üîç This project uses:

**Iris dataset** for classification (visualized using 2 features)

**Diabetes dataset** for regression (using a single feature for 1D visualization)

üìä Visualizations and performance metrics (Accuracy and MSE) are included to help understand how both models operate differently under the hood.

### üß† Tech Stack:

* Python
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* numpy
üí° Great for beginners learning how SVMs work in classification vs. regression tasks.
