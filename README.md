# SVM-Classification-vs-Regression-SVR-with-scikit-learn
A simple Python project demonstrating the difference between Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and regression (SVR) using scikit-learn. Includes visualization and evaluation of both approaches on real datasets.

**SVM for Classification:** The model finds the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes with maximum margin.

**SVR (Support Vector Regression):** The model fits a hyperplane that predicts continuous values while allowing for a margin of tolerance (Œµ-insensitive zone).

### üîç This project uses:

**Iris dataset** for classification (visualized using 2 features)

**Diabetes dataset** for regression (using a single feature for 1D visualization)

üìä Visualizations and performance metrics (Accuracy and MSE) are included to help understand how both models operate differently under the hood.

### üß† Tech Stack:

* Python
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* numpy
üí° Great for beginners learning how SVMs work in classification vs. regression tasks.
